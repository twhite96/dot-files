# Espanso Textexpander

I've pared down as many either expensive and/or non-essential subscriptions from my budget as possible. While browsing a Mastodon server that I now cannot remember, someone mentioned that they use FOSS for a lot of tools they used to pay for.

TextExpander by Smile Software is really great and powerful, however, I can no longer afford it, and because there are even more extensible alternatives for free, I decided to give Espanso a try.

The config file in this directory are some of the expansions that I've created.
